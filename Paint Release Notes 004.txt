   o Knows if image has been saved recently and prompts for a save option if not saved.
   o Option to cancel the exiting of the program.

Future Plans (Not including next assignment… just with this stuff)
 - Include option to save without file picker, just using path file was loaded from, or the last path the file was saved to.
 - Include option to close the picture (show nothing) without closing the entire program.
 - Accelerators (Alt + key) for the menu options.
 - Include options for dashed lines and such.
 - Change width option from slider to something else - more exact input that way.
 - Add icons for different shapes and options instead of text.


Known Issues
 - The window still can be sized to very small sizes… would like to limit how large and small the user can resize the window.
 - Sometimes images are too large for the window. Would like to deal with that… possibly scale them down to fit the window… and then add some sort of zooming feature. And some sort of scrolling feature.
 - Drawing off of the image is shown in preview... not of critical importance to fix.
 - Would like the toolbar layout to improve.
 - Freedraw doesn't start until mouse is dragged... would like to have it start with mouse click.
 - Selection throws errors when mouse is moved out of bounds. However, the program does not crash. A new, proper 
selection can be made and it will work as expected.
